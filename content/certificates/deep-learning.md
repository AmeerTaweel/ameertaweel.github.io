I started taking the [Deep Learning Specialization][specialization] offered by
[DeepLearnin.AI][deep-learning-dot-ai] on [Coursera][coursera].
The specialization consists of five courses:

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning][course-1]
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization][course-2]
3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects][course-3]
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks][course-4]
5. [Sequence Models][course-5]

I have completed the first course of the specialization successfully:

1. [View Course 1 Certificate][course-1-certificate]

I started taking the second course of the specialization.
