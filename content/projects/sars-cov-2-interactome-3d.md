This project is a web-based server for navigating and visualizing possible
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and human host
proteins.

I gained valuable experience working on this project, as this is my first time
contributing to scientific research. I was responsible for building the
serverside API and the client webpage. I developed the API using PHP and the
webpage using both JavaScript and PHP.

I also learned a lot about the research topic itself, working with a team, and
the process of doing scientific research.

The research was published in [*Bioinformatics*][bioinformatics], a leading
journal in genome bioinformatics and computational biology.
